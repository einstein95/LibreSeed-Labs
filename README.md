**LibreSeed Labs** is a fully open-source reimagining of the original Steam title *Upload Labs* — rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on **freedom, creativity, and player control**.  

Our mission is simple: deliver the same core gameplay experience without the baggage. No invasive telemetry. No premium upgrades. No DRM. Just a fun, moddable game anyone can enjoy — and anyone can improve.

## ✨ Why LibreSeed Labs?

- 🛑 **Zero Ads, Zero Trackers**  
  We stripped away all telemetry and analytics to respect your privacy.
- 🔓 **Everything Unlocked**  
  All content is free and available from day one — no microtransactions, ever.
- 🛠️ **Built for Modders**  
  With full source code included, modding and custom builds are only a Git clone away.
- 🧩 **Standalone & DRM-Free**  
  No Steam client, no external dependencies — just launch and play.

---

## 🪓 What's Gone

- ❌ **Discord Rich Presence**  
  We removed Discord RPC integration to keep the game lightweight and privacy-first.  
  (But you’re welcome to add it back in a fork!)
